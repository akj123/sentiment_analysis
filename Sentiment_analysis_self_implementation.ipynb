       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

       "\"I really liked this Summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason. Anyways, this could have been one of the best Summerslam's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but I'm glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes on Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took on Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending. However it deserves 8/10\""

    "## Bad review\n",
    "\n",
    "review_1 = \"I have a migraine watching this cringe movie. Literally every aspect of this movie is cringe. And in terms of originality, this is Rajneeti meets Kabir Singh with an overdose of papa, papa. Give it a rest, you can love your father without being abusive to the rest of the world. And the great thing is that there is still no closure for the audiences who've been wound up for 3.5 hours in the hope of at least a detente. The 'visionary' directory Sandeep Reddy Vanga goes to town bringing every debunked cliche to life - the cliched 'alpha' shtick, the slap-happy father who favors the son-in-law over his own son, the subjugated wives and mother, the 1 'alpha' killing 100 of people (not an exaggeration) armed with a couple of axes, creating 'body doubles' as if that's a thing. The funniest part is that the climax fight with Bobby Deol literally has its own narration ongoing in the form of a song in the background - as if singing â€˜Ye dekho kaisa thappad maara~â€™ with every slap landed. No closure is offered to any of the sub plots ongoing with the protagonists - the relation with the wife, the kids or even the father. To compensate for this, Sandeep Reddy Vanga overcompensates with gratuitous violence to satisfy the enraged crowd watching this trash, never having been involved in as much as a scuffle, much less an actual fight. The plot is as simple as it gets, and it's clear Sandeep Reddy Vanga didn't have a story to tell, as much as a couple of ideas for scenes he wanted to execute based on his diminutive understanding of Marathi music, fetishization of Sikh Youth and culture and more importantly, his bloodlust to satisfy. Such is the bloodlust, that even the post-credits scene is drenched in more blood than most animes, and that's saying a lot.\""

This movie will be Mega Hit and with this Ranbir has emerged as the roaring Lion in the industry and many records will be broken .Do not miss the opportunity to watch in the cinemas to enjoy the Animal experience.. I always thought no one can come close to how Yash oozes power and charisma in KGF but Ranbir outshines all superstars in this role by showcasing different looks from youth to old age with such perfection, once again showing what a phenomenal actor he is. While there are super stars who can make a movie work just from looks, dialogues and style, Ranbir is an acting powerhouse and the scenes he is in, you just cannot take your eyes off him. This is one of the few movies you can watch more than once as there is so much to absorb in almost every scene, you end up missing some aspects! My eyes fixated on Ranbir - totally smitten with the way he emotes just with his eyes, perfection in overall look at different stages of life, his natural subtle dialogue delivery and my ears on music, will need one or two times more to process other aspects!\""
